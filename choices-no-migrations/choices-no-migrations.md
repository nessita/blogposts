I've been spending a non trivial amount of time going through some
investigation and trial-and-error attempts to come up with a way to have Django
Models' fields with `choices` constructed from fairly-but-not-completely-static
list of options, and avoid generating a migration every time such list changes.

The two use cases that I have are the following:

 1. Allow for a list of `choices` to be defined via the project's settings
    file. Every project setup will have their customized list of choices,
    though it is likely that once set, it'll (almost) never change.
 2. Use 3rd party apps that provide a list of `choices` for well-known lists of
    values, such as currencies, countries, languages, etc.

My goal in both cases is that, if the choices from the settings file change, or
if a country or currency spelling changes, there is no need to generate a new
migration. Since this task proved to be more challenging than what I
anticipated, I decided to write my first blogpost ever.

Before jumping into the juicy details, let's propose a simple example for an
expense tracking Django app, where an `Expense` model is defined, similar to
this one (simplified version!):

```python
from django.db import models
from django.utils.timezone import now


class Tag(models.TextChoices):
    FOOD = 'FD'
    HOUSING = 'HS'
    TRANSPORTATION = 'TR'
    UTILITIES = 'UT'


class Expense(models.Model):
    what = models.TextField()
    when = models.DateTimeField(default=now)
    amount = models.DecimalField(decimal_places=2, max_digits=20)
    tag = models.CharField(max_length=2, choices=Tag.choices)
```

With its corresponding initial migration:

```python
from django.db import migrations, models


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    initial = True

    dependencies = []

    operations = [
        migrations.CreateModel(
            name='Expense',
            fields=[
                (
                    'id',
                    models.BigAutoField(
                        auto_created=True,
                        primary_key=True,
                        serialize=False,
                        verbose_name='ID',
                    ),
                ),
                ('what', models.TextField()),
                (
                    'when',
                     models.DateTimeField(default=django.utils.timezone.now),
                ),
                (
                    'amount',
                    models.DecimalField(decimal_places=2, max_digits=20),
                ),
                (
                    'tag',
                    models.CharField(
                        choices=[
                            ('FD', 'Food'),
                            ('HS', 'Housing'),
                            ('TR', 'Transportation'),
                            ('UT', 'Utilities'),
                        ],
                        max_length=2,
                    ),
                ),
            ],
        ),
    ]
```

Every time we change the definition of `Tag`, a new migration is generated.
For example, suppose we add a new tag for `clothing`:

```diff

Running `makemigrations` would generate a new one that looks like this:

```python
from django.db import migrations, models


class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('expenses', '0001_initial'),

    operations = [

            model_name='expense',

                max_length=2,
            ),
        ),
    ]
```

According to many Stackoverflow reports (for example [this
one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46945013/django-migrations-changing-choices-value),
or [this
one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30630121/django-charfield-choices-and-migration),
or even [this
one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31788450/stop-django-from-creating-migrations-if-the-list-of-choices-of-a-field-changes))
which reference various Django bugs (ultimately pointing to [bug
22837](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22837)), this behavior is by
design.

In most cases this is not an issue at all, but for the two use cases that I
listed in the introduction, this is quite annoying.

Concretely, I have pet project for expense tracking that uses
[django_countries](https://pypi.org/project/django-countries/). This library is
used to associate expense entries with the country they originated from. Every
time I update my project dependencies, it's likely that a new version of
`django_countries` would generate a new migration for my app because of a small
fix in a country name or similar.

So, given the above and following the expense tag example described before
(where the list of tag choices is very likely to be customized by each expense
tracking system installation), I started investigating how to allow for
`choices` values to be defined from almost-static sources without generating
migrations every time that this value list changes.

Therefore, I read the Stackoverflow posts and their linked bugs, and I found
out that (in theory) this issue would be workaround-able by [passing a callable
to choices](https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/22837#comment:4). This
approach made total sense to me and I went happily and quickly to create a PR
with this change:

```diff
--- a/choices-no-migrations/example/expenses/models.py
+++ b/choices-no-migrations/example/expenses/models.py
@@ -13,4 +13,4 @@ class Expense(models.Model):
     what = models.TextField()
     when = models.DateTimeField(default=now)
     amount = models.DecimalField(decimal_places=2, max_digits=20)
-    tag = models.CharField(max_length=2, choices=Tag.choices)
+    tag = models.CharField(max_length=2, choices=lambda: Tag.choices)
```

I then ran the tests to ensure things worked as expected, but...

```
ERRORS:
expenses.Expense.tag: (fields.E004) 'choices' must be an iterable (e.g., a list or tuple).
```

Naturally, I searched for the documentation to check how the callable should be
passed to the `choices` param (at the time of this writing, the doc is
[here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field.choices)),
and to my surprise there was no mention of allowing a callable at all.

Even worse, the docs would say that *...if you find yourself hacking `choices`
to be dynamic, youâ€™re probably better off using a proper database table with a
`ForeignKey`.* The thing is that I don't think I'm better off using a separated
table for my use cases... the country or currency lists are _static enough_ for
them to make sense as constants. And more importantly, if any of those change
their spelling or something, I love the ability to fetch these updates from
upstream instead of me having to be aware of them and applying them in the
database.

Some more googling after and I came across [this other
post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33514058/django-creates-pointless-migrations-on-choices-list-change/33514551#33514551),
where the most voted response says *I think you're mixing up the `choices`
argument on a `Model` field, and that on a `forms.ChoiceField` field.*

Eureka! I was (also) indeed mixing up the two fields: not in my head, but my
searches weren't specific enough, and the search results were sort of also
mixing those two up. So back to square zero where I need my tag list to be
taken from a settings value and ideally not having new migrations generated
when that setting changes.

I tried a few things that did not work out, until a colleague suggested that I
may need to edit the latest migration to replace the explicit tag list with the
variable definition, and this way the "migration system" would be happy enough
that `Tag.choices` is not changing thus not producing a new migration on tags
update. So:

would successfully allow for my use case! After this change, adding to or
removing from the tag list and then running `makemigrations` would not detect
any changes:

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations

```

It's worth noting that after I completed my solution, and when I started
writing this post, I've found a [similar writing from
2017](http://tech.yunojuno.com/pro-tip-django-choices-and-migrations) which
proposes an analogue solution, but I figured this post was worth writing anyway
since I spent hours banging my head against the desk until I solved it.
